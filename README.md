# C Library for ILI9341 2.8 TFT LCD Display

## ILI9341 Description
Detailed information are described in [Datasheet ILI9341](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ILI9341.pdf).

## Library
C library is aimed for driving [ILI9341 2.8 TFT LCD display](#demonstration) 240x320 using 8080-I/II Series Parallel Interface.

## Hardware connection
| PORT LCD | PORT ATMEGA328P | Description |
| :---: | :---: |  :---: |
| 5V | 5V | Supply Voltage |
| 3.3V | NC | Not Connected |
| GND | GND | Ground |
| RST | PORTD 4 | Reset |
| CS | PORTD 3 | Chip Select |
| RS | PORTD 2 | Register Select (Data / Command) |
| WR | PORTD 1 | Write |
| RD | PORTD 0 | Read |

### Usage
Prior defined for MCU Atmega328p / Atmega8 / Atmega16. Need to be carefull with pins definition. **_Data pins D[7:0] using one port and are in order!_**.

### Tested
Library was tested and proved on a **_ILI9341 2.8â€³ TFT Dispay_** with **_Atmega328p_**.
